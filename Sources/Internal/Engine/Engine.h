/**
    \ingroup engine
    Core component of dava.engine which manages application's control flow.
    
    Client applications and other parts of dava.engine interact with Engine in one way or another.
    For any application there is precisely one Engine object.
    
    Engine's responsibilities are:
        - It initializes low level platform dependent objects and works directly with operating system.
        - It receives events from underlying system and dispatches them to client application through signals.
        - It initializes dava.engine's modules or subsystems and provides them to application through EngineContext object.
        - It manages window creation and destruction.
        - It controls game loop.
        - It performs some other important tasks:
            - application exit,
            - getting command line
            - running arbitrary client-supplied functor in context of thread where game loop is running, etc.
    
    The Engine object is intended to be the only singleton in dava.engine and is accessible through Instance() static method.
    
    The Engine object **must** be created and initialized before any use of dava.engine's modules or subsystems. Only few subsystems
    can be used immediately after Engine creation and before initialization:
        1. Logger
        2. FileSystem
    
    C/C++ main() function is buried deep inside dava.engine and client application shall provide its entry function DAVAMain:
    \code
    int DAVAMain(DAVA::Vector<DAVA::String> cmdline);
    \endcode
    
    Engine can run game loop in several modes (see eEngineRunMode):
        - as GUI application
        - as console application
        - as GUI application embedded into other framework, now only Qt is supported
    
    The following sample shows how to use Engine:
    \code
    #include <Engine/Engine.h>
    using namespace DAVA;
    int DAVAMain(Vector<String> cmdline)
    {
        Engine engine; // Create Engine object
        eEngineRunMode runmode = eEngineRunMode::CONSOLE_MODE;
        if (cmdline.size() > 1)
        {
            // Depending on command line choose run mode
            runmode = cmdline[1] == "--console" ? eEngineRunMode::CONSOLE_MODE : runmode;
            runmode = cmdline[1] == "--gui" ? eEngineRunMode::GUI_STANDALONE : runmode;
            // To run in embedded mode application must link with Qt
            runmode = cmdline[1] == "--embedded" ? eEngineRunMode::GUI_EMBEDDED : runmode;
        }
        engine.Init(runmode, Vector<String>(), nullptr); // Initialize engine
        return engine.Run(); // Run game loop
    }
    \endcode
*/
class Engine final
{
public:
    /**
        Return a pointer to Engine object or null if Engine is not created yet.

    static Engine* Instance();

    Engine();
    ~Engine();

    Engine(const Engine&) = delete;
    Engine& operator=(const Engine&) = delete;

    EngineContext* GetContext() const;
    NativeService* GetNativeService() const;
    Window* PrimaryWindow() const;

    eEngineRunMode GetRunMode() const;

    bool IsEmbeddedGUIMode() const;
    bool IsConsoleMode() const;

    /**
        Initialize Engine object and create primary Window object (if not console mode).
        This method sets desired run mode, lists modules which should be created and assigns engine options.
        Engine object must be initialized before using dava.engine.
    
        Engine can run game loop in several modes (see eEngineRunMode enum):
            - as GUI application (eEngineRunMode::GUI_STANDALONE)
            - as console application (eEngineRunMode::CONSOLE_MODE)
            - as GUI application embedded into other framework (eEngineRunMode::GUI_EMBEDDED)
    
        Application may list dava.engine's modules (subsystems) which she wants to use during execution. List may be empty.
        For now application may choose to create only several subsystems:
            - DownloadManager
            - JobManager
            - LocalizationSystem
            - NetCore
            - SoundSystem
            - PackManager
    
        Other modules are always created implicitly depending on specified run mode, e.g. UIScreenManager, InputSystem are not
        created in console mode.
    
        Additionally application can set options to tune dava.engine and its modules (can be null). If no options are given then dava.engine
        chooses some reasonable default value. List of options supported by dava.engine:
